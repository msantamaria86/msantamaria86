Howdy!
Mi name is Miguel and i love people, after traveling for years through Latin America and Africa, i discovered that i wanted to try and improve others lifes, specially those that were not being able to reach all tools available to them.

ðŸ¤” Not long ago i was a petroleum engineer.
Luckily I realized the coding industry is more in line with my personal goals and expectactions. My ultimate goal is taking part in the blockchain industry, being able to take part in a technology that stands to take over the world.

âš¡ After succesfully completing the web developer bootcamp at Le Wagon i learned the following languages/tools: 

* Ruby - Ruby on Rails
* SQL - PostgreSQL - SQLite3
* Html5 - Css - Bootstrap
* Javascript - Ajax
* Github, trello, Figma âš¡
